# City premium diary — implementation checkpoint 1

This branch is deliberately **not** ready for deployment. Main/production is unchanged.

## Added
- `src/city_diary_model.js`: pure, side-effect-free, per-event planning model.
- `tests/city_diary_model.test.mjs`: tests for validation, independent month entries, revision conflicts, state transitions, and date filtering.

## Domain decisions
- Event modes: reminder / publication.
- Actions: profile / rating / review / rating_review.
- Event timestamps use canonical UTC ISO 8601; future UI converts to the client's selected timezone, displayed explicitly. Calendar days must be computed in that timezone, not by slicing UTC timestamps.
- Scheduled publication requires an existing profile and the text for a review. This plan alone grants no authorization to publish.
- Status 'awaiting_confirmation' means Telegram has requested user confirmation; 'submitted' means handed to existing City processing; 'completed' requires verified success from that processing.
- Reminders need a separate delivery/acknowledgement life-cycle before integration; no automatic transition is performed by this pure model.
- Cancellation of a scheduled plan is separate from cancelling an already submitted publication.
- Credits are **not** touched at scheduling time by this checkpoint. Integration must avoid locking existing publication claims months in advance, especially if several planned events target the same profile.
- Stored review text and all profile data are private client information; no URL-accessible read APIs without Telegram authentication.

## Required before integration
1. Inspect existing Web App / Mini App views and bot navigation.
2. Design private per-client DO event storage; enforce auth and optimistic revision concurrency.
3. Add dedicated alarms or appropriately shared per-user scheduling, including retry and no duplicate deliveries.
4. Design credit holds and cancellation policy with the existing publication guard, daily profile caps, ADMIN queue and settlement.
5. Add black-and-gold month calendar and Telegram notification messages.
6. Add integration tests (Telegram failures, idempotent callbacks, restart/retry, credit reservation, proof-based completion).
7. Run repository test suite and review all diffs before any production merge.

Local test command: `node --test tests/city_diary_model.test.mjs`.
No live publication, credit adjustment, Telegram send or ADMIN operation is performed by these additions.
